# Executive Summary

Write something here

# Disclaimer {.unnumbered}

The opinions and views expressed in this manuscript are those of the author, and do not necessarily state or reflect those of any institution or government entity.

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Read in the Dataset

Idol School (偶像學校)

```{r idol-school-data}
library(readxl)
idol_school = read_excel("UNFINISHED_Idol_School_Dataset.xlsx")
idol_school[,-3]
```

## Test for Non-English Characters

CJK = Chinese, Japanese, Korean

Chinese example

RStudio有辦法打中文嗎？

```{r print-Chinese}
print("大家好，很高興能認識你們！")
```

Japanese example

思い出にするにはまだ早すぎる

```{r print-Japanese}
print("みやわき さくら")
print("宮脇 咲良")
```

This template does not support Korean characters yet.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
