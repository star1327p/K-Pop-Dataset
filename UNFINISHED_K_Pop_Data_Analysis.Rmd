\renewcommand{\cite}{\citep}

```{r latex-cite-command, include=FALSE}
# %\let\cite\citep
# % from \citep to \cite to cite in author style, e.g. [Mule, 2008]

# % \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
# %\citep: citation in parentheses, e.g. [Mule, 2008]
# %\citet: citation as author, e.g. Mule [2008]
# %\cite: citation as author, \citet by default 
```

## Read in the Dataset

Idol School (偶像學校)

Motivation: One of the contestants, Snowbaby (蔡瑞雪),^[Snowbaby's YouTube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@snowbaby>] is originally from Taiwan.

```{r idol-school-data}
library(readxl)
idol_school = read_excel("UNFINISHED_Idol_School_Dataset.xlsx")

columns_to_show = c("Chinese_Name", "English_Name",
                    "Vocal", "Dance", "Physical", 
                    "Overall", "Basic_Strength_Ranking")

# UNFINISHED: Prevent columns from truncating!

idol_school[1:10, columns_to_show]
```

## Test for Non-English Characters

CJK = Chinese, Japanese, Korean

Chinese example

RStudio有辦法打中文嗎？

```{r print-Chinese}
print("大家好，很高興能認識你們！")
```

Japanese example

思い出にするにはまだ早すぎる

```{r print-Japanese}
print("みやわき さくら")
print("宮脇 咲良")
```

This template does not support Korean characters yet.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
